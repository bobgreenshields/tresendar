For the past 2 months RBs have been capturing travelers and holding them in these pens until they could be sold into slavery.

* Filthy straw lines the floors of the cells
* Doors to the pens are secured by chains and padlocks
* 2 disheveled human woman are held in the south pen
* a human boy in the north
* dressed in grey tunics with iron collars on their necks
* a heap of discarded clothing agianst the far wall

The 2 RBs are taunting their captives.  If they hear fighting they will take positions against the wall near the door to surprise anyone entering.
