3 Stone sarcopahagii hold the remains of elders of the Tresendar family, propped against each is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail.  False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees.

Fighting in this room alerts the RBs in area 5.

Skeletons attack anyone coming within 10 ft of the doors to 5 or 6 unless they are wearing a scarlett cloak or speak a password.
