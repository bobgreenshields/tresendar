A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh.  A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the 20ft high ceiling.  Two arched bridges span the chasm.

The tunnel to the south continues for 100ft and emerges in the woods south of the manor.  The RBs use it to smuggle goods and people in and out of Phandalin.  Ideal for thieves and slavers.

Glasstaff has struck a deal with the Nothic to guard the complex in exchange for some loot and occasional fresh meat.  Still, the Nothic is untrustworthy.

### Nothic
* lurks behind column on west side
* uses Weird Insight to sense characters secrets
* communicates telepathically
* fills party's heads with foul murmurings and demands for food
* prefers negotiating and will betray the RBs for the right incentive (promise of food)
