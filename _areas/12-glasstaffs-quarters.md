If approached through the secret door from 7 they can surprise GS.  Otherwise he will have been forewarned by his rat familiar.

* walls are covered in drapes of scarlet cloth
* small writing desk, matching chair, confy bed
* wooden chest at the foot

if surprised - sitting at the desk is a short dark bearded human male in robes, studying a tome.  He wears a princely mantle of ermine.  A beautiful glass staff leans against his chair in easy reach.

Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly Iarno's written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop.  Some, for equipment, are addressed to Hagar.  A letter bearing the black spider symbol is also present.  See handout.
