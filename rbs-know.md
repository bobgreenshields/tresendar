# What the Redbrands (and Nothic) know
* RB leader is a human wizard known as Glasstaff because his staff is made of glass
* His chambers are in the western end of the stronghold
* A mysterious figure call the Black Spider has hired the RBs
* To frighten off adventurers and prospectors, and intimidate the locals
* The BS has sent bugbears to reinforce the RBs and provide extra muscle
* The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous eye monster
* The RBs have a few captives in a holding area near the old crypts
* Which are guarded by skeletons
