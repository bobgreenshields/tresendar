Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isnâ€™t incapacitated.

Notes: if a spell has an attack roll it is at disadvantage.  If it just results in the target making a save it is not.
